This sketch was made for the "openhouse" festival: http://design.lavillahermosa.com/works-3-open-house-2012 in 2012. We used it to generate maps and posters for the festival.

It's basically an experiment about paths extrapolations. The program takes paths from an existing svg file and extrapolates them. When two paths cross, they join each other.

Interesting results can be achieved when playing with the parameters.
